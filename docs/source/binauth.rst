BinAuth Option
=================

Overview
********

**BinAuth provides a method of running a post authentication script** or extension program. BinAuth is ALWAYS local to NDS and as such will have access to all the resources of the local system.

*BinAuth is available when FAS is used at all levels of fas_secure_enabled (0, 1, 2 and 3).*

**A custom variable is forwarded to BinAuth** This can contain an embedded payload of custom data defined by the FAS. As FAS is typically remote from the NDS router, this provides a link to the local system.

**BinAuth has the means to override session timeout, data rate and data volume quotas** on a client by client basis.

**BinAuth is called by openNDS at the following times:**

 * After the client CPD browser makes an authentication request to openNDS
 * After the client device is granted Internet access by openNDS
 * After the client is deauthenticated by request
 * After the client idle timeout interval has expired
 * After the client session timeout interval has expired
 * After a data upload or download quota has been exceeded
 * After the client is authenticated by ndsctl command
 * After the client is deauthenticated by ndsctl command
 * After NDS has received a shutdown command

BinAuth Command Line Arguments
******************************

When OpenNDS calls the configured BinAuth script, it sends a set of command line arguments depending on the reason for the call.

BinAuth Command Methods
-----------------------

The first argument, arg[1], is always the "method".

The method will be set to one of the following values:
 * "**auth_client**" This is a request for authentication by the client.
 * "**client_auth**" This is an acknowledgement of successful authentication by NDS.
 * "**client_deauth**" This is an acknowledgement that the client has been deauthenticated by NDS.
 * "**idle_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because the idle timeout duration has been exceeded.
 * "**timeout_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because the session length duration has been exceeded.
 * "**downquota_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because the client's download quota has been exceeded
 * "**upquota_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because the client's upload quota has been exceeded
 * "**ndsctl_auth**" - NDS has authorised the client because of an ndsctl command (for example, sent by the NDS AuthMon daemon).
 * "**ndsctl_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because of an ndsctl command.
 * "**shutdown_deauth**" - NDS has deauthenticated the client because it received a shutdown command.

Additional arguments depend on the method type:

Method auth_client
------------------
The first argument is auth_client and the following arguments are set to:

 * arg[2] = client_mac
 * arg[3] = username (deprecated)
 * arg[4] = password (deprecated)
 * arg[5] = url-escaped redir variable (the URL originally requested by the client.
 * arg[6] = url-escaped client user agent string
 * arg[7] = client_ip
 * arg[8] = client_token
 * arg[9] = url-escaped custom variable string

Method ndsctl_auth
------------------
The first argument is ndsctl_auth and the following arguments are set to:

 * arg[2] = client_mac
 * arg[3] = bytes_incoming (set to 0, reserved for future use)
 * arg[4] = bytes_outgoing (set to 0, reserved for future use)
 * arg[5] = session_start - the session start time 
 * arg[6] = session_end - the session end time
 * arg[7] = client_token
 * arg[8] = url-escaped custom variable string

All Other Methods
-----------------
When the first argument is other than auth_client or ndsctl_auth, the following arguments are set to:

 * arg[2] = client_mac
 * arg[3] = bytes_incoming (total incoming bytes for client)
 * arg[4] = bytes_outgoing (total incoming bytes for client)
 * arg[5] = session_start - the session start time 
 * arg[6] = session_end - the session end time
 * arg[7] = client_token

Using the Custom Variable string
--------------------------------
Method auth_client - arg[9] and ndsctl_auth - arg[8], contain the url-escaped custom variable string. openNDS extracts this variable from the query string of the http auth_client call from a FAS or PreAuth page.

It is provided for general unspecified use and is url-escaped.
A typical example of its use is for a level 0, 1, or 2 FAS to communicate special values for individual clients, or groups of clients.

Example BinAuth Scripts
***********************
An example BinAuth script is pre-installed.
It provides a local NDS Access Log

FAS is often remote from the NDS router and this script provides a simple method of interacting directly with the local openNDS. FAS can send custom data to BinAuth as a payload in the custom variable string that is relayed to BinAuth.

The log file is stored by default in the operating system tmpfs volatile storage area to prevent flash storage wear.

On OpenWrt this location is /tmp/ndslog/

and on Debian and OpenSuse it is /run/ndslog/

The location is automatically detected on most operating systems.

Free space checking is done and if the log file becomes too large, logging ceases and an error is sent to syslog.

Log files do not persist through a reboot so if required the location can be changed to, for example, a USB stick.

**The binauth_log example is pre-installed.**

This script has a single component, the shell script:

 *binauth_log.sh*

The file binauth_log.sh is preinstalled in the /usr/lib/opennds directory.

This is enabled by setting the BinAuth option in the config file (/etc/config/opennds on Openwrt, or /etc/opennds/opennds.conf on other operating systems.

This script is then activated with the command:

    ``service opennds restart``
